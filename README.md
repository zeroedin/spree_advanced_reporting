# NOTES:

This is working with Spree 1.0.0; don't know about prior versions.

For Spree 1.1.0 (and possibly later), use the master branch.

Forked from what appeared to the be the most up to date for, and made the following general changes:

1. Removed PDF generation, which isn't working under Ruby 1.9.x
2. Removed the route that overrides the main admin overview page
3. Fixed a warning about ```ADVANCED_REPORTS``` being redefined
4. Fixed the en.yml translation lookups


# Note
This extension seems in flux, having many forks, but no official rails3 update.
